- fix selection rectangle error
  - if cursor out of bounds, coords are not clampe to bounds
    - add additional check!
- fix floodfill within selection
  - not a feature as such but can be used at this time
  - selection rectangle color is same as exclusion color so if two overlp, there
    can be hole for the flood to escape
  - change selection color slightly
- use the imagery selection to select the background tiles for forest/thermal editing
- fix thermal index issue - read a version of thermal map with index instead of thermal index.

- for t_Pen moved by more than +/- 1 pixel -> draw in between points!

v0.7 - 02 jan 2019
- fix recursive frame bug in WriteCondorXfile
- add 'alternate' background bitmap for editing forest/thermals

- change initial Object folder to be 'Landscapes'
- If no 'Working' folder, don't try to save Gradient file

v0.7.5 - Oct 2019, Mar 2020
- add quarter tile KML, GDAL, and DDS for processing screen captures from Google-Earth for
  older imagery.
- add quarter tile GMID to use GMID or GEID for older imagery  
- fix bug - flying range which need to use Northing and Easting
- UTM_Right and UTM_Bottom - standardize - problem between tile corner versus tile centre !  What is correct ?
  - read from TerrainHeader - UTM_Bottom = Northing + 45 i.e. TerrainHeader has extents, but UTM has centre of tile  
  - Scenery header - UTM_Bottom as is.
  - MakeTileList - Northing = UTM_Bottom - 45, i.e. back to extent, as it assumes centre of tile for UTM_Bottom
  - KML - uses extents from tile list
  - DEM - KML - need to offset to create proper tile list
  - DEM - DEM - uses corners
  - DEM - SceneryHeader file - corners, not centre - fix ?

      - change way +/- work and re-centre on cursor click zoom/unzoom ???
  - add DDS generation (DXT3)
  - add utility to convert from DXT3 to DXT1 4 colors
    - Landscape Editor uses nvdxt dxt1c but nvdxt bug does dxt1a only, 3 color and alpha, 
      and has extra bug which can causes transparent spots in dark areas
      - DDS batch file now uses dxt3, 4 colors instead as a workaround. Convert back to DXT1 to save 50% size
	  - no, DDS batch still uses dxt1c
  - add support for command line version of AllMapSoft GMID Combiner

  - add import of landscape APT.csv file from Working folder
  - add water-tile generation batch files
    - GDAL_Translate does not support 32 bit map BMP i.e. with transparency ! so it does not work !
	- change to TIFF instead of BMP, GDAL_Translate nows cuts tile in 4x4 OK
	- However, nvdxt uses only 0 or 15 for transparency in DXT3, not 15 levels ???
  - WGET_Generic - for use with ArcGIS for example - need URL and type

Issues:
- Condor_Tiles does not use calibration data for showing airports and objects so they will be
  incorrectly placed. 90 m dx and dy assumed !

- if reading c3d file with object name containing a space -> creates issue as parse of X, cx, px files use a space as delimiter ! - creates problem with re-read of generated x, cx, px file
- no possible workaround.  don't use object names with spaces !
- convert space to '_' on read of c3d ?  would re-write with '_' of course. Is that an issue ?

- drawing on top of selection box causes issues ? - turn off box first and turn back on after
