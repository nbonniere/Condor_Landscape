If you want to use the Condor2 Landscape Editor to examine and possibly modify a Landscape, the Landscape Editor will initially only show a greyscale texture map of the elevation and you are limited to the viewing/modifying of the HeightMaps, the Airport list, and the Object list, with no access to the ForestMaps or the ThermalMap or Textures.

In Condor2, the Landscape data is stored as follows:

- The elevation data: folder LandscapeName\HeightMaps\*.tr3
- The texture data: LandscapeName\Textures\t*.dds
- The forest maps: LandscapeName\ForestMaps\t*.for
- The thermal map: LandscapeName\LandscapeName.tdm
- The airport list: LandscapeName\LandscapeName.apt
- The airport Ground features: LandscapeName\Airports\AiportNameG.c3d
- The airport Object features: LandscapeName\Airports\AiportNameO.c3d
- The airport Ground and Object textures: LandscapeName\Airports\Textures\*.dds *.bmp *.tga *.png
- The object list: LandscapeName\LandscapeName.obj
- The object files: LandscapeName\World\Objects\*.c3d
- The object textures: LandscapeName\World\Textures\*.dds *.bmp *.tga *.png

There is also two hash table files to confirm the validity of data as follows:

- Validity of HeightMaps: LandscapeName\LandscapeName.tha
- Validity of ForestMaps: LandscapeName\LandscapeName.fha

The landscape Editor has direct access to the HeightMaps in the folder LandscapeName\HeightMaps

The Landscape Editor shows the texture with files in the folder:
- LandscapeName\Working\Textures
Initially these files contain a greyscale view of the elevation

The Landscape Editor shows the forest map with forest files in the folder:
- LandscapeName\Working\ForestMaps
Initially there are no files

The Landscape Editor shows the thermal map with the file:
- LandscapeName\Working\ThermalMap.bmp
Initially there are no file

With Condor_Tiles it is possible to export the Textures, Forest map and thermal.

Start the landscape Editor and pick the Landscape and use the 'Read Header' button to determine the details of the landscape.

To Export the Textures, select the Utilities button, and select 'Convert DDS to 24 bit bitmaps' 'Convert' button. Select all files in the LandscapeName\Textures folder with Ctrl-A, or a single file of interest. The files will be created in a new folder LandscapeName\Textures_Export. You can then:
- rename the folder LandscapeName\Working\Textures to LandscapeName\Working\Textures_Initial
- rename the folder LandscapeName\Working\Textures_Export to LandscapeName\Working\Textures
The texture data can then be viewed in the Landscape Editor.

To Export the forest map, select the Utilities button, and select 'Convert forest map (FOR)' 'Export to BMP' button. Select all files in the LandscapeName\ForestMaps folder with Ctrl-A, or a single file of interest. The files will be created in a new folder LandscapeName\Working\ForestMaps_Export. You can then:
- rename the folder LandscapeName\Working\ForestMaps_Export to LandscapeName\Working\ForestMaps
The forest data can then be viewed in the Landscape Editor, when you zoom-in close.

To Export the thermal map, select the Utilities button, and select 'Convert thermal map (TDM)' 'Export to BMP' button. Select the file  LandscapeName.tdm. A new file LandscapeName.tdm-bmp.bmp will be created in the folder LandscapeName. You can then:
- move the file LandscapeName.tdm-bmp.bmp into folder LandscapeName\Working
- rename the file LandscapeName\Working\LandscapeName.tdm-bmp.bmp to LandscapeName\Working\ThermalMap.bmp
The thermal data can then be viewed in the Landscape Editor.
