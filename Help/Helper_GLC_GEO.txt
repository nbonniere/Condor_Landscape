For thermal and tree map generation, it can be done by hand, basically ‘painting’ forests, roads, fields, etc.. onto a background of each tile. This takes way too long, but will match the textures very closely. Manual Editing can be done to 'touch-up' forests around airports.

An alternate way is to use the database which has shape files for roads, lakes, rivers, forests, etc...  Such a database is not complete, but for some areas it is quite good. Whatever is missing can then be filled in manually.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
In Condor-V1 the various maps had this resolution:

Terrain-map – 90m
Thermal-map – 90 m
Combined forest map with
- Deciduous Forest-map – 45m
- Coniferous Forest-map – 45m
Textures maps – variable resolution in Textures folder

-----------------------------------------------------------------
In Condor-V2 the various maps have this resolution:

Terrain-map – 90m and .tr3 maps at 30m in HeightMaps folder
Thermal-map – 90 m
Combined forest maps in .for ForestMaps folder with
- Deciduous Forest-map – 11.25m
- Coniferous Forest-map – 11.25m
Textures maps – variable resolution in Textures folder

-----------------------------------------------------------------
An alternate way is to use the database from Maryland University which a Global-Land-Cover database which includes forests.

https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GLCLU_2019/download.html

Data available on-line from:
https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-land-cover-land-use-v1. 

Dataset Details:
This global dataset is divided into 10x10 degree tiles, consisting of two files per tile. All files contain unsigned 8-bit values and have a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second per pixel, or approximately 30 meters per pixel at the equator. For more information please refer to the above publication. The 'Map' file has the neded information. It includes a global map with continuous measures of bare ground and tree height inside and outside of wetlands as well as of builtup area and binary labels of water, ice, cropland, and recent tree cover loss.

Each Tile covers 10 degrees of latitude and longitude and is sized 40,000 x 40,000. At the equator this provides a resolution of 27.8m x 27.8m.  At 45 deg latitude, the resolution is: 19.6m x 27.8m. A at 60 deg latitude, the resolution is: 13.9m x 27.8m. The resolution is a little coarser than what Condor V2 can provide.

Condor_Tiles:
There is a pull-down box at the top named 'GEO Data'. For the Maryland University Global-Land-Cover, database, select 'GLC'.

There is a button on Condor-Tiles ‘Make-Geo’, that creates a GeoDatabase folder and creates batch files for each condor tile. In the status message box, it will show a list of the names of the data files to download from the GLC download site. In the GeoDatabase folder, there will be a GLC_WGET.bat batch file that can be used to download the data files.

In each Working\SourceTiles\xxxx folder, there will be 3 batch files. One for thermal, GEO_t_0000.bat, one for deciduous forest GEO_V2_b_0000.bat, and one for coniferous forest GEO_V2_s_0000.bat. You can run these batch files individually or use the 3 batch files, GO_b.bat, GO_s.bat, GO_t.bat, in the GeoDatabase folder that call all the individual batch files, one at a time. It is best to start by doing one tile individually, and viewing the resulting bitmaps for color features, and then run the overall GO batch file to generate all tiles. The bitmap for the thermal is in each source tile folder Working\SourceTiles\xxxx and called xxxx_t.bmp for tile xxxx. The bitmap for each forest tile is in Working\Terragen\Forests folder and named bxxxx.bmp for each tile. The bitmaps can be viewed with any graphics viewer/editor. The bitmaps should show various features in color, such as roads and rivers.

Note that GLC has only a ‘forest’ definition, not a deciduous nor a coniferous distinction. A blank coniferous map will be generated as it is needed for the Landscape Editor.

You can view and modify the resulting tiles with Condor_Tiles with the ‘Edit Forest’ and ‘Edit thermal’. The background textures tile is shown and is overlaid with the thermal or forest. Press the ‘v’ key to toggle the overlay.

Because the database resolution is limited, it may be necessary to 'shrink' the forest to provide more margin around lakes, rivers, roads, so that no tree ends up on roads or lakes, etc...

Forest maps end up in Working\Terragen\ForestMaps folder, and with the Landscape Editor, you can use Tools 'Import tile size forest maps', then in Files 'Export forest maps (FOR)', and then in Files 'Export forest hash (FHA)'. To see the forest in the Landscape Editor, you need a checkmark in the 'Forest maps' check-box, and you need to zoom in quite close before the tree map shows.

Thermal maps stay in each Working\SourceTiles\xxxx folder. You need to create a folder Working\ThermalMap. There is a button on Condor_Tiles ‘Make thermal’ that will generate the thermal map.  Each type of geographic structure is assigned a thermal value 0 to 255 (0 to 100%), basically a heat index for thermal generation. You can edit the default values if you want. To see the thermal map in the Lanscape Editor, copy the file Working\ThermalMap\ThermalMap.bmp into the Working folder and put a checkmark in the 'Thermal map' check-box.
